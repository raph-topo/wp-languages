Composer plugin to download translation files for WordPress core, plugins and themes from wordpress.org.

Optimized for the [Roots](https://roots.io/) stack, particularly Bedrock, but can be adapted to other setups based on Composer.

Instructions are given relative to the Bedrock root folder, usually `site`.

## Installation

Install with:
```bash
$ composer require raph-topo/wp-translations
```

Set the following options in `composer.json`:
```json
{
    "extra": {
        "wordpress-translations": [ "fr_FR" ],
        "wordpress-languages-dir": "web/app/languages"
    }
}
```

The [Translate WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/) page lists available locales (column *WP Locale*)

## Usage

### Behaviour

Composer will try to install translations from through the WordPress.org API every time you install or update a package.

### Extant projects

To force-update translations for already installed packages, delete the contents of `web/app/plugins` (keep any `.gitkeep`) and run `composer install`
